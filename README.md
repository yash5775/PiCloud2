## Apple Human Interface Guidelines Implementation

This project follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) to create a consistent, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience across all Apple platforms.

### Key HIG Principles Implemented

#### Layout and Typography

- **Minimum Text Size**: All text is at least 11 points for legibility at typical viewing distances without zooming
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent spacing system with small (8pt), medium (16pt), and large (24pt) values
- **Alignment**: Text, images, and buttons are properly aligned to show relationships

#### Touch Controls

- **Minimum Hit Targets**: All interactive elements are at least 44Ã—44 points for accurate tapping
- **Natural Gestures**: UI elements designed for touch interaction
- **Feedback**: Visual feedback on button presses

#### Visual Design

- **High Contrast**: Sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds for legibility
- **Color Adaptation**: Colors adapt to light/dark mode automatically
- **Proper Aspect Ratios**: Images displayed at intended aspect ratios

#### Navigation

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear information hierarchy with proper headings
- **Consistent Controls**: UI controls placed near the content they modify

### Components

The project includes a `UIComponents.swift` file with reusable components that follow HIG:

- Typography styles (title, headline, body, caption)
- Button styles with proper touch targets
- Card and list item components with consistent spacing
- Form elements (text fields, toggles)
- Responsive containers that adapt to different screen sizes

### Color System

The color system includes:

- **Accent Color**: Primary brand color that adapts to light/dark mode
- **Secondary Color**: Complementary color for UI elements
- **System Colors**: Integration with iOS system colors for backgrounds and text
- **Semantic Colors**: Colors for success, warning, error, and information states
